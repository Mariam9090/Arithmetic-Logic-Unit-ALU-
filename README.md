# Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU
This repository contains the complete implementation of a custom 4-bit Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU) designed using digital logic principles and implemented in Verilog , including:

Full arithmetic and logical operations
Input/output flip-flops
Testbench simulations
Transistor-level schematics
Power consumption and delay analysis
Transient simulations under worst-case conditions
